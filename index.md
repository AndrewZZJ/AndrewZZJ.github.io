Hi, I'm Andrew, a master student major in Software Engineering.

This contents of this blog are for recording my LeetCode practice, my thoughts about technologies, and my personal projects.

My relating experience includes, not limited to, the following topics:
- AWS services
- Camera testing
- Frontend programming
- Neural Network programming
- Computer Vision programming
- Algorithms
- Physic emulation

Now, I plan to put my efforts on:
- Backend programming
- Game development
- Frontend programming

In my free time, I like to learn new technologies, play video games (especially Nintendo's), do sport, and watch funny videos.

Thank you for visiting my website!
